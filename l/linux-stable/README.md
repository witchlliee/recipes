## Kernel packaging process on AerynOS

This is intended as an introduction to one way of doing kernel maintainenance on AerynOS.

We expect kernel maintainers to know their way around patches and kernel configuration in general.

Use e.g. https://kernelconfig.io to look up definitions of what kernel options do.


### 1. Update the upstream version and tarball

As with any package, update your `stone.yaml` to point to the latest tarball.

```
grep http stone.yaml
# (output elided)
# use this output to create a `boulder recipe update` invocation
boulder recipe update --ver <the version> --upstream <the matching upstream uri>
```

### 2. Check if the kernel builds

As with every other package, you build the kernel with `just build`.

Every build runs `make oldconfig` to ensure that new kernel options get picked up.

If you receive no questions and the kernel build finishes like you expect, congratulations,
you're done updating the kernel.


### 3. The build asks `make oldconfig` configuration questions

This is an indication that you need to update the kernel configuration in `pkg/config-x86_64`.

This is done inside the kernel chroot:

setup section before:

```

    %install_file %(pkgdir)/config-x86_64 .config
    %make CC=%(cc) LD=%(ld) ARCH=x86_64 LLVM=1 LLVM_IAS=1 WERROR=0 oldconfig || exit 1
```

setup section that has been prepared for doing a `make oldconfig` run inside the build chroot:

```

    %install_file %(pkgdir)/config-x86_64 .config

    # show the command to run this correctly in the chroot
    echo "%make CC=%(cc) LD=%(ld) ARCH=x86_64 LLVM=1 LLVM_IAS=1 WERROR=0 oldconfig || exit 1"

    # exit the chroot when exiting the chroot shell, failing the build
    %break_exit
```

Exchange `oldconfig` with `nconfig` if you need to make more in-depth adjustments to the kernel config.

Note that previous kernel configuration experience is assumed.

#### How to smuggle the new config out of the guest buildroot

The newly updated kernel `.config` in `%(workdir)` needs to be smuggled out from the build container to the host and saved.

This is done by opening a new tab/shell on the host, navigating to the l/linux-stable dir, and doing a copy operation that looks akin to this:

    cp -v ~/.cache/boulder/build/linux-stable-<version>-<source-release>/x86_64/linux-<version>.tar.xz/.config pkg/config-x86_64

At that point, all that's left is to run `git diff .` to check that everything looks sane.

Finally, exit the chroot and restart the build.


### 4. Some patches fail to apply

The recipe has been set up to enable you to comment out individual patches from the `pkg/patches/series` file.

Simply repeatedly run `just build` with more and more failing patches commented out until the setup phase completes.

You can optionally replace `%break_exit` with `%break_continue` in the last step, which will make the build continue after you exit the chroot shell.


### 5. Kernel rebuild story

When submitting a PR, it is important to also remember to either update or `just bump`, then `just build` the below list of stand-alone extra kernel module recipes with the kernel added to your local repo:

- `bcachefs-module`
- `broadcom-sta-module`
- `nvidia-open-gpu-kernel-modules`
- `v4l2loopback-module`
- `zfs-module`

If you update the `nvidia-open-gpu-kernel-modules` recipe (rather than just bumping it), you will also need to ensure that the `nvidia-graphics-driver` recipe is in sync.


### Conclusion

Once the kernel builds and you have tested that it boots and works on your local machine, you can submit a PR.

Best of luck on your kernel maintenance journey. ^^'

## initramfs notes

To ensure better scalability and reproducibility, we use pre-built initrds instead of dkms.

However, multiple initrds have some interesting... properties... due to them using CPIO filesystems.
Basically the problem is that multiple initrds are not actually "merged", but that the kernel checks inodes in reverse order and only the first matching one is read.
So when the kernel goes to lookup /etc it will find /etc in the nvidia initrd and read the list of entries from it.
It will only have /etc/systemd and that /etc/systemd will only have /etc/systemd/system.conf.d and so on.
Essentially every other file in /etc/ that's in the main initrd will not be visible to any processes running.

Now that may or may not cause an actual error, but it's definitely not something we want.

To avoid that behavior we have a rule where initrd extensions can only have top-level directories and files that do not conflict with any ones in the main initrd.

That's why we add /eb-fw and /eb-nvidia-fw to the kernel firmware search paths via a patch, if you tried to have them in /lib/firmware it would cause /lib to get masked which would be very bad since that's where all the kernel modules and firmware is loaded from.

If you use rd.break=pre-udev to break and drop into a shell during the init you can do a ls /etc and see what this means.

## Troubleshooting initramfs

In order to troubleshoot issues happening during initrams, it can be helpful to drop to a shell in order to examine the initrd environment. To do this:

1. Reboot and hold any key besides enter or one that triggers the BIOS/UEFI until the systemd-boot loader shows up (I usually use the CTRL key)
2. Hit `e` to edit the kernel args
3. Delete both `quiet` and `splash`
4. Add the following `SYSTEMD_SULOGIN_FORCE=1 rd.break=pre-mount`
5. Hit enter
6. Dracut will pause during boot and prompt you to hit enter to drop to a shell. Do so.
7. You are now in a root shell with the ability to examine the initrd.
8. To resume boot run `exit`

View https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/dracut.cmdline.7.html if you need to stop during any other part of the initrd.

Note that this particular troubleshooting approach can come in very handy when troubleshooting NVIDIA driver woes, as it is possible to install the NVIDIA driver in a test VM with no ill effects and then inspect the initramfs containing the nvidia driver with the above approach.
